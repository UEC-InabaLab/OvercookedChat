**OvercookedChat** is a human-collected Japanese dialogue dataset for real-time collaborative tasks. 
This dataset was collected through collaborative work between players with pre-assessed task proficiency in a real-time cooperative cooking game environment inspired by the popular game "Overcooked." 
This dataset was collected using an offline cooperative cooking game environment specifically designed to support controlled two-player experiments.  
‚û°Ô∏è The implementation of the data collection environment is available here:

This work has been **accepted to the main conference of SIGDAIL 2025**.

## üåü Key Features
- **111 Game Dialogues** : A collection of dialogues from 54 participants engaged in a real-time, high-pressure collaborative cooking game.

- **3,412 Annotated Utterances**: Captures spontaneous, spoken Japanese communication, with each utterance tagged with one of 16 dialogue acts (e.g., Inform, Request, Suggest).

- **Rich Multi-Modal Data**: Synchronizes dialogue with 48,781 in-game actions, game scores, and detailed post-session feedback for a holistic view of the collaboration.

- **Post-Session Subjective Feedback**: Gathers player perspectives on cooperation, communication, and adaptation through an 8-item, 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire after each game.
